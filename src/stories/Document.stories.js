A DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization. That’s quite a mouthful, but let’s understand what it means.

</br>

- Decentralized: A decentralized group handles the entity's governance rather than a centralized board.
- Autonomous: An entity that can govern by itself without requiring any external help.
- Organization: A group of people  working towards a common goal or purpose.

</br>

Putting it all together, a DAO is an organization governed by its people. These people must hold the native token to participate in various governance procedures. But, thanks to its community-owned model, DAOs can organically incentivize their members to get maximum value for putting in the labor. So, what kind of labor does a DAO demand? What are the different roles that you can take up within the ecosystem? Let’s take a look.

</br>

## **DAO vs Traditional Organization**

To understand the roles required in DAOs, let’s see how their structure differs from traditional organizations.

## **Roles required in DAOs**

DAOs can be versatile. However, they require labor to function correctly. It doesn’t matter if they are protocol DAOs like Maker or social DAOs like Bankless. Each DAO has its own mission, which requires specific skill sets. This article will look at roles in MakerDAO and how they compare with traditional organizations.

</br>

### **Facilitators**

A Facilitator is a trusted actor in the MakerDAO community. They bridge the gap between the Contributors and the Maker Governance. A Facilitator’s responsibilities include anything from general administrative tasks to governance schedule.

</br>

Here is a quick overview of their responsibilities.

- Run weekly governance meetings.
- Deploy and govern Core Units. Core Units are self-sufficient teams that manage specific verticals within the Maker Protocol. The Units handle different parts of the protocol operations, such as Growth, Oracle, etc.
- Manage budgets for their Core Units
- Focus on implementing policy, procedure and facilitation.
- Maintain communication channels within MakerDAO to ensure healthy internal and external comms.
- Create on-chain polls for the community to vote on various MIPS (Maker Improvement Proposals). An improvement proposal is a design document that empowers the community to suggest various ideas to upgrade the protocol. If the MIP gets an appropriate number of votes, it gets implemented.
- In an emergency, the Facilitators are responsible for working with the community and deploying an emergency voting process to mitigate the scenario.

</br>

In a decentralized governance system, all users and stakeholders must constantly communicate on various issues. To that end, the Facilitators play a crucial role in facilitating this communication by:

- Maintaining and encouraging healthy and constructive debate following pre-established rules of conduct.
- Communicate the upcoming governance schedule with the required stakeholders at least a week in advance.
- Ensuring the new community members know the basic method and code of conduct.
- Increasing participation by stakeholders in the governance process.
- It should help to build and maintain morale and engagement among members of the governance community.

</br>

This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as their roles are concerned. Every facilitator will have unique roles and responsibilities to serve their Core Unit best.

</br>

However, as you can see, this role is crucial, and it requires someone who is well-versed in the Maker ecosystem and is well-regarded and trusted within the community. As of now, there are **[22 facilitators](https://forum.makerdao.com/g/Core-Facilitators)** within the Maker ecosystem.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

In traditional organizations, Facilitators would be high-ranking managers managing their groups and verticals within the company. However, managers are often insulated in their decision-making and don’t necessarily need to convene with their team. Facilitators must engage in conversation and debate with other community members to get the necessary consensus.

</br>

### **Delegates**

Delegation has always been one of the main focuses of Maker governance. Any Maker community member can become a delegate and promote themselves to get as much support as possible. These delegates are folks who are extremely educated about MakerDAO and are well-equipped to make crucial decisions.

</br>

MKR holders who agree with their vision can vote for the delegate with their tokens. A successful delegate will gain immense voting power due to the delegated MKR. Do note that an MKR holder may withdraw their support for their delegate any time they want and back someone else.

</br>

So, why is vote delegation so important for decentralized governance?

</br>

Think of how elections work in a proper democracy. The people don’t govern the country. Instead, they elect officials who are in charge of the governance. The same logic applies to Delegates.

- You find a delegate that you like.
- You vote for that delegate.
- If the delegate gets enough votes, they get elected to the office of power.

</br>

The GovAlpha Core Unit is responsible for simplifying governance by making the process pain-free for delegates. The Core Unit is also responsible for convincing MKR token holders to delegate their holdings to the Delegates.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

Governance is critical in DAOs, more so than in traditional organizations, wherein the leaders are, more or less, insulated from the rest of the organization. The GovAlpha Core Unit is vital in ensuring high participation from MKR holders and reducing voter apathy.

</br>

### **Protocol Engineers**

MakerDAO requires protocol engineers to support the functionality of the Maker Protocol technologically. Their responsibilities include:

- Increasing the protocol's functionality by implementing new smart contracts and censorship-resistance mechanisms.
- Maintain existing smart contracts by fixing bugs and ensuring that the different parts of the system are interacting correctly.
- Ensuring safety and correctness at the design and implementation levels, from bytecode to game theory.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

So, how do DAO-related protocol engineers differ from your everyday software engineers? MakerDAO’s protocol engineers have a background in software architecture and/or software engineering with a comprehensive understanding of blockchain fundamentals, security architecture, consensus algorithms, formal modeling and verification, and smart contract development experience.

</br>

The main thing to keep in mind here is that DeFi (decentralized finance) is an extremely experimental field. Not only is it extremely demanding when it comes to innovativeness, hackers tend to target this protocol because of the sheer amount of money to be made here. As such, protocol engineers in DeFi must:

</br>

- Embrace paired programming and asynchronous peer reviews to deliver code that’s of the highest quality.
- Modularize code to keep contracts simple and the attack surfaces small
- To ensure code security, maintain an active relationship with auditors and bug bounty hunters.
- Stick to constant testing and industry standards.

</br>

Of course, software engineers must deliver high-quality code no matter which industry they are in. Let’s just say that the stakes in DeFi are a little higher.

</br>

### **Recruiters**

As with any organization, recruitment is the key to sustainable scalability. As with any organization, efficient recruitment is the key to sustainable scalability. If the recruitment process isn't done well, then you risk:

</br>

- Working with incompetent people
- Increased employee turnover
- Not hitting the KPIs needed to make your organization grow.

</br>

A good recruiter is responsible for the following:

</br>

- Be a brand ambassador for the company and engage with the candidates to make them want to join the team.
- Screening the prospects to narrow down the search as much as possible.
- Finding prospects that are best suited to your organization.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

Recruiters in a DAO also follow the same principles. However, in a decentralized organization, onboarding and offboarding talent efficiently could be challenging because of these reasons:

</br>

- The talent could be plugged into various facets of the DAO.
- It isn’t easy to find good talent for a field as innovative and new as DeFi.

</br>

In MakerDAO, the Sustainable Ecosystem Scaling (SES) Core Unit is responsible for providing a positive onboarding experience for new participants. Plus, SES also incubates new teams and core units to check if the team can take care of a particular project and if they have adequate resources to fulfill their KPIs.

</br>

**NOTE:** The overall SES purview is a lot more diverse. Recruiting is just a small part of what they offer.

</br>

### **Risk Analyst**

Risk analysts are responsible for supporting and improving the organization’s approach to holistic risk management. The Risk analysts do the following:

</br>

- Compile and evaluate risk data.
- Share their findings with the concerned team to think of possible solutions.

</br>

A risk analyst’s job can be very challenging since they must make several difficult decisions that could have huge ramifications on the company’s operations.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

So, how does risk analysis change in a DAO like Maker? Since MakerDAO and the DAI stablecoin are so popular and deeply integrated into DeFi, risk management becomes even more critical. Hence, risk analysts have to be highly skilled at evaluating other crypto assets or protocols in DeFi.

</br>

MakerDAO risk analysts must not only do regular risk analysis, but every single potential parameter change needs to be double and triple-checked since:

</br>

- An error could have negative ramifications across the entire DeFi ecosystem.
- Because of the sheer amount of money involved, a simple error could lead to a million-dollar debacle.

</br>

The Risk Core Unit members are responsible for taking care of Maker’s risk analysis. Along with taking care of risk analysis, the core unit does the following:

</br>

- Perform regular research on potential new protocol design topics.
- Monitor the DeFi landscape.
- Study and consider potential integrations by other protocols.

### </br>

### **Pen Testers**

A penetration test (pen test) is a controlled cyber attack against a company that’s purposefully done to check the protocol’s defenses. Pen testers are cybersecurity experts that conduct these tests to find ways to patch up vulnerabilities in a protocol’s attack surface.

</br>

Pen testers use a variety of tools to find these vulnerabilities. These tests are conducted via the following stages:

</br>

- Planning: Meticulously define the course of action and the end result by conducting proper recon.
- Scanning: Understand how the protocol’s defenses and systems will respond to the intrusion.
- Intrusion: In this stage, the pen tester uses the knowledge gained in the first two stages to access the company’s systems.
- Staying inside: In the fourth stage, the pen tester attempts to stay within the system.
- Analysis: Analyze the results of the pen tests and come up with the best course of action for security augmentation.

</br>

**Parallels with traditional organizations**

While pen tests can be pretty thorough, they are more of a “one-and-done” deal. As we know, for all its innovativeness, DeFi can be highly vulnerable to attacks. To combat these hacks, protocols must adopt a stance of continuous vigilance. One of the best ways to do this is via bug bounties.

</br>

Bug bounties allow developers (bounty hunters) to discover and resolve bugs in a protocol’s attack surface. A robust bug bounty program can be significantly more efficient than pen tests due to the following:

</br>

- It allows you to be tested by multiple developers asynchronously.
- A bug bounty can be a continuous endeavor.
- Having a generous bug bounty reward can attract some of the most talented bounty hunters to thoroughly test and vet your protocol.

</br>

Being one of the leading DeFi protocols, MakerDAO takes the matter of cybersecurity very seriously with a record-breaking $10 million bug bounty program. To manage the bounty hunters and analyze their findings, MakerDAO has established the ImmuneFi Security Core Unit. The members of this core unit are essentially responsible for assessing the threat levels of the findings made by these bounty hunters and passing them along to the relevant team members.

## **Conclusion**

As you can see, traditional organizational roles translate over to DAOs with some minor (or major) changes. If you work in a DAO, you must realize that your actions may not necessarily be limited in a silo. You will likely need to be sensitive to the needs of the entire organization.
